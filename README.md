- 👋 Hi, I’m @ErickZR750
- 👀 I’m interested being a programmer but I regret making this decision
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and Database with MySQL
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to learn all these programming languages and hope I can make something presentable.

Actually, if you're reading this thanks for stopping by, I'm guessing you have the same goal like me, more or less. Wishing you the best luck and hope you can hone your skills for your challenge ahead.
